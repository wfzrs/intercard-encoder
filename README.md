# Installation
## EZPZ Install Script

**Okay I tried to make this as easy as humanely possible. **

1. Get a Raspberry Pi or Linux computer
2. Open a terminal window
3. Copy and paste the command below, then hit `ENTER`:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wfzrs/intercard-encoder/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
```
4. Wait for the script to finish doing its thing.
5. That's it, everything should be installed and configured correctly. Reboot the pi, log in, and it should take you straight to the Intercard encoding program
